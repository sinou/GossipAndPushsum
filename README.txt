This is a scala project implementing the distributed signal processing protocols Gossip and Push-sum.
In this project, you will see the implementation of this protocol in scala using AKKA actors and and 
result paramters are stored in a mySQL DB for various sets of inputs. A chart and graph report is built
using this data in PHP and Javascript.
